## 🧠 How It Works

1.  The player clicks one of three buttons: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2.  The computer randomly generates its choice.
3.  The game logic compares the choices based on the classic rules:
    -   **Rock** crushes **Scissors**
    -   **Scissors** cuts **Paper**
    -   **Paper** covers **Rock**
4.  The score is updated, and the result is displayed on the screen.
5.  The game continues until the player decides to reset.
